As reference and guide I have used the videos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjkSFoLxesw&ab_channel=Dave%2FGameDevelopment and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHV1ymlw-P8&t=273s&ab_channel=Brackeys

I have spent a lot of time on research and understanding the code and videos before using them. With them I have created a whole different game for payload/escort where the red team takes the payload to the other side while blue team defends.
